### (Virtual Steering Wheel Extension)

The Virtual Steering Wheel Extension project aims to revolutionize the gaming experience by enabling users to control the steering wheel of vehicles in racing games using hand gestures captured by a webcam. This README file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, technologies used, system design, deployment, and testing.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the Virtual Steering Wheel Extension is to offer a novel gaming experience, eliminating the need for traditional keyboard inputs and providing users with intuitive control over vehicle steering in racing games. By leveraging hand gesture recognition technology, the extension enhances immersion and interaction, making gaming more enjoyable and realistic.

### Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: Chosen for its ease of use, extensive library support, and integration capabilities.
- **OpenCV**: Employed for image processing tasks, particularly for capturing and analyzing webcam feed.
- **MediaPipe**: Used for hand gesture recognition, allowing users to control the steering wheel through hand movements.
- **NumPy**: Facilitates array manipulation and mathematical operations required for processing image data.

### System Design

The system design encompasses various elements, including workflow diagrams, UML diagrams (activity, state, use case, and sequence diagrams), and technical specifications. These design elements provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture, functionality, and interactions.

### Deployment and Testing

Deployment involves ensuring compatibility with different operating systems and gaming environments. The software testing process employs both white box and black box testing methodologies to verify functionality and performance across various scenarios. Thorough testing ensures the extension operates seamlessly and delivers an immersive gaming experience to users.

### Results

The successful deployment and integration of the Virtual Steering Wheel Extension with the Aircraft Game demonstrate its capabilities in enhancing the gaming experience. Users can download the extension and game from the Star Softek website, which serves as a platform for interaction and feedback.
